"""
Business-term registry — Phase 1 of the retrieval accuracy roadmap.

Loads embedding_building/business_dictionary.yaml (aliases, acronyms, synonyms)
into three lookup structures. This is the SINGLE place expansion/alias logic
lives; src/retriever.py's `_expand_query` and the query-rewrite layer
(src/query_rewrite.py) both delegate here rather than each re-implementing
their own regex list.

Why not keep the old `_QUERY_EXPANSIONS` list in retriever.py: it is
acronym-only (a plain find/replace) and cannot express an ALIAS (a surface
form that pins one specific table), which is what fixes real source-data label
drift — see the "part b"/"part c" collision comment inline in the yaml file for
a concrete, confirmed case. A hardcoded Python list also cannot grow with the
dataset the way a YAML file — versioned and lintable the same way
`semantic_layer.yaml`/`qa_pairs.json` already are in this codebase — can.
